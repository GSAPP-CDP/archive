In an era where the digital and real worlds increasingly converge, the rise of virtual influencers marks a significant evolution in our digital landscape. As technological advancements empower creators with more robust world-building and photo manipulation capabilities, influencers now possess unprecedented possibilities in visual content production, reshaping reality itself. This project is anchored within this burgeoning phenomenon, aiming to explore the trajectories of virtual entities and their profound impact on social norms, with a particular focus on female growth and societal expectations. This exploration is critical, especially since one of the most rapidly disseminated contents on social media revolves around the aesthetics of female appearance and physique.

The scope of this project encompasses the creation of an interactive experience using a game engine. Through this medium, the project seeks to provide a critical commentary on the stereotypical norms and inspire a reevaluation of the societal lens through which female appearance is viewed.

Furthermore, the project will extend its impact beyond the interactive experience by translating some of these narratives into social media posts. These posts will aim to spark dialogue and reflection among a wider audience, challenging prevailing stereotypes and encouraging a broader understanding of the complexities surrounding female growth.

In summary, this project is not just an exploration of the technological advancements in creating virtual influencers but also a critical examination of the societal narratives that shape our understanding of female growth. By intertwining technological innovation with social commentary, this project aims to contribute to the shaping of digital culture, offering insights into the future of digital interaction and its potential to influence societal perspectives on gender and growth. Through this endeavor, we seek to illuminate the path for a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of the digital and societal landscape surrounding female growth.

"Bernice's introductory talk collaborated using GenerateAI-written content, and her expressions were animated with LiveLink facial capture. It’s not flawless—her gaze might wander—but as technology advances, I anticipate even more natural expressions."
