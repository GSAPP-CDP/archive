# Project Description

Have you ever wondered what it would sound like if our brain activity could be turned into music? In a city as vibrant yet stressful as New York, at every street corner, at every moment, our brains are emitting their own melodies. How different would the music of our brains be when strolling on a busy commercial street compared to navigating through a noisy subway?

These questions led me to explore how to convert our brainwaves into music, creating a new perspective on how we interact with our surroundings. 
In my daily urban life, I often feel a direct impact of the surrounding environment on my emotions. This sensation made me curious: Can we quantify this impact from a scientific perspective?
