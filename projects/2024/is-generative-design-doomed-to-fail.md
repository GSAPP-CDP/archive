# Project Statement

Generative Design, while encountering challenges in its integration into the broader spectrum of architectural design, exhibits significant potential for enhancing specific phases, as demonstrated in my ongoing project. In particular, I have found it to be a valuable tool in expediting the Test Fit process of the Schematic Design phase.

In the context of my current project, Generative Design has proven instrumental in rapidly generating and evaluating multiple design alternatives. By inputting specific parameters and constraints, the tool facilitates the exploration of diverse spatial configurations, allowing for quick identification of optimal solutions. This not only accelerates the design iteration process but also ensures a more informed decision-making approach.

The ongoing nature of my project serves as a real-time case study, showcasing how Generative Design contributes to a faster and more effective design process. While acknowledging its limitations in addressing the entirety of architectural design, the focused application of Generative Design in the Test Fit phase underscores its potential as a powerful ally in achieving both efficiency and design excellence.
