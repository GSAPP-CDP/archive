## 1 – Background

### **Re-Imagining Apartment Hunting: An Immersive Approach**

<br>
<br>

![Decision Fatigue](/img/2025/suji/cover-gif.gif)

**Background**

My research focuses on how the overwhelming number of choices in apartment hunting apps affects user decision-making. Current real estate platforms present too many options, often sponsored by large tech companies, which can obscure what users truly need or want. This abundance leads to decision fatigue and the paradox of choice, where more options make it harder to make decisions.

I aim to explore how curated content influences user preferences, often prioritizing price and location.

My research will examine how a more personalized, user-focused approach can improve decision-making and enhance the overall experience in navigating complex housing options.

**Starting from Personal**

<br>

#### 1. International Student

- Unable to visit units in person, I can only evaluate the location.
- I lack knowledge of the neighborhoods I would walk through daily or the atmosphere I would experience.
- Current apps provide polished photos, making it difficult to perceive the true scale of the space.

#### 2. Using Architectural Knowledge

- Put insufficient information together using my architectural knowledge.
- Extract floor plans from real estate platforms to generate 3D models for understanding spatial scale.
- Utilize Google Maps to analyze geological and urban contexts, focusing on transportation and accessibility.
- Evaluate daylighting availability to assess environmental performance.
- Incorporate data from open-source platforms for supplementary insights and validation.

## 2 – Hypothesis

What should be the most important thing in the process of finding an apartment?
<br>
<br>

> # **'Lifestyle'**

> # **'Preferences'**

## 3 – Apartment Selection Factors

<br>

### Apartment Selection Factors

**Building Scale Level** and **Unit Scale Level**

Based on my personal struggles in finding an apartment in NYC,  
I believe the factors I chose can help narrow down apartment options  
and selection.

These factors can be divided into two levels:

#### 1. Building Scale

- **Accessibility**: Understanding the context and connectivity of the neighborhood.
- **Daily Routes**: Showing everyday paths and exploring new connections.

#### 2. Unit Scale

- **Daylighting Availability**: Assessing the quality of natural light in the units.
- **Open Space and Scale**: Examining the influence of open space on spatial experience and perception.

## Building Scale Approach

![Building Scale](/img/2025/suji/building-scale-approach.png)

The **Building Scale Approach** provides a 3D map-based interface that helps users visualize key factors when selecting an apartment. It allows users to explore **daily routes** based on their preferences, such as commuting to work, visiting a park, or shopping for groceries. The interface highlights these routes, showing travel modes like walking, cycling, or driving, and includes detailed step-by-step directions.

Additionally, it offers insights into the **accessibility** of these destinations within the neighborhood, enabling users to understand the connectivity and proximity of essential amenities. This spatial representation helps bridge the gap between raw data and an intuitive understanding of how the neighborhood functions in daily life.

## Unit Scale Approach

The **Unit Scale Approach** enhances the apartment selection process by providing a **3D, first-person experience** to analyze **Daylighting Availability** within the unit. This feature enables users to understand how natural light flows into the space and plan furniture arrangements accordingly.

Additionally, it offers the ability to toggle on **Furniture** and **Pet** options to visualize the scale of the space and evaluate its suitability for living with pets. This immersive experience ensures that users can make informed decisions based on spatial feasibility and personal preferences.
