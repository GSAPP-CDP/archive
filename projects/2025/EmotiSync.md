# EmotiSync

**Emotion-Sensing Adaptation for Your Schedule**  
EmotiSync is an intelligent scheduling assistant that adapts your daily flow based on your emotional state‚Äîrestoring focus and emotional balance in a distracted world.

Rather than optimizing for productivity, EmotiSync listens to how you feel. It offers gentle task guidance that helps you recover from stress, maintain flow, and reconnect with your inner rhythm.

## Concept

EmotiSync harnesses Hume AI‚Äôs Empathic Voice Interface (EVI) to analyze users' emotional expressions in real-time through voice input. Based on these signals, it dynamically suggests tasks that either relieve, sustain, or gently shift your emotional state.

This system challenges conventional productivity tools by prioritizing emotional well-being over rigid planning‚Äîempowering users to work with their moods rather than against them.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Emotion Detection with Hume AI EVI**  
  Real-time voice analysis for 53 nuanced emotional states.

- üîÅ **Adaptive Task Suggestions**  
  Tasks adjust dynamically based on emotional feedback‚Äîcategorized by stress levels (High, Moderate, Low), relaxation, and focus.

- üåà **Emotion-Mapped UI**  
  A color-coded interface that visualizes emotions and schedules with clarity and empathy.

  ![Demo UI](/img/2025/emotisync/ui.jpg)  
*Emotion-adaptive interface with chained task suggestions: the system activates with human presence, listens, and adapts tasks based on user input.*

- üï∞Ô∏è **Circadian Rhythm Integration**  
  Task timing suggestions align with natural energy cycles using a trained LSTM model.

- üéµ **Ambient Response**  
  Music and visuals shift to support recovery, focus, or relaxation.
