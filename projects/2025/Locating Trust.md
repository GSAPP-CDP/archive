![On Sociality,](/img/2025/Locating_trust/02_Research.png)
Stephen Levinson’s work on the Human Interaction Engine attributes three properties of Human social interaction: The attribution of intention through behavior mapping onto goals, mutual salience or common ground—necessary for cooperative interaction, and intentions that drive behavior solely effected by virtue. Because technology and tools become an extension of our cognition, it is important to explore and create new configurations of sensors and rulesets to afford a different texture of presence that preserves the elements of our human sociality. This is a socially oriented practice, which aims to create new social structures and scaffolding for more authentic relations than incumbent digital systems do. This practice blends both commercial use-case with grassroots rapid prototyping of different protocols for organizing communities.

According to the Carson College of Business’ 2024 American Travel Survey, over a third of Gen Z (38%) and Millennials (34%) expect to spend “a lot of time” comparing costs of travel destinations and activities the next time they travel. Gen Z — 20.2% of the U.S. population and about 32% of the global population— heavily relies on technology, including Tiktok and Instagram for travel inspiration,AI-generated itineraries and mobile apps, for planning and booking their trips. Mental health and wellness are important travel motivators, as 93% report that travel positively impacts their well-being. Millennials—represent about 22% of the U.S. population and constitute 27% of the global population (around 2 billion people), travel more than any other demographic, averaging 35 days of vacation per year. Millennials prioritize experiences over material goods, seeking authenticity, fulfillment, and sustainability in their travel choices.

On Future,
What if we reclaimed our sociality and relied on horizontal relational knowledge to see the world? Just as Language shapes culture and culture shapes thought, Our technology shapes our cognition which shapes our thoughts. Computational advancements in recent years increasingly afford the ability for ambient computation, so lets put people first. If trust and meaning is contextualized by the people around us and pro-social communication, and the ability to establish and sustain joint attention constitute some of the basic building blocks of intersubjectivity, then lets flatten the dimensions of technology to afford us to focus on the thing that matters most: People.
