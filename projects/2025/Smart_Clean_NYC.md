# Smart Clean NYC

CityServe: Autonomous Restaurant Waste Collection Network

# Background Info

New York City generates approximately 44 million pounds of waste daily. The DSNY collects about 24 million pounds from residential sources, employing around 7,200 workers during the day and operating more than 2,000 garbage trucks at night.
Additionally, around 4,000 private trucks from 250 sanitation companies manage commercial waste, including waste from over 11,000 restaurants citywide. Despite workers putting in 10-14 hour shifts, six days a week, the high restaurant density, heavy traffic, and limited parking in Manhattan make waste collection especially challenging.

# System Introduction

Smart Clean NYC is an innovative waste collection and transportation system designed for Manhattan, New York City, with an initial focus on restaurant waste management.
01/ Waste Disposal by Restaurants
Restaurants sort waste into color-coded bags and place them in underground storage.
02/ Overflow Detection & WCP Dispatch
System monitors storage capacity and dispatches WCP when needed.
03/ Waste Loading into WCP
WCP collects sorted waste from restaurant sites.
04/ Waste Transfer to WCB
WCP transfers collected waste to WCB at docking stations.
05/ Final Waste Processing
WCB transports waste to designated processing facilities.

# Core Modules

The following modules represent the core focus of my project, designed to improve restaurant waste collection in Manhattan.
Waste Collection Pods (WCP)
Autonomous ground collection vehicles.
Waste Collection Boats (WCB)
Floating waste transfer stations on Manhattan’s waterfront.
Color-coded Waste Bags
Ensure source separation of different waste types.
Green (organic waste) Blue (recyclables)
Red (hazardous waste) Grey (other waste)
Restaurant Waste Management Hub
Enables restaurants to automate waste collection by summoning WCPs, scheduling pick-ups, and managing billing, enhancing operational efficiency.

# Expected Outcomes

01/ Less garbage exposure
– Smart Clean NYC enables faster waste pickup from restaurants, reducing odors, limiting rodent access, and keeping sidewalks cleaner.
02/ Reduced traffic congestion
– Waste Collection Pods (WCPs) are compact, intelligently reroute around traffic hotspots, and can use bike lanes when roads are blocked, helping maintain smooth traffic flow.
03/ Quieter urban environment
– Smart Clean NYC uses electric-powered pods (30–40 dB), replacing noisy diesel trucks (80+ dB) and creating a quieter, more livable city.
04/ Lower emissions, cleaner air
– Powered by electricity and other clean energy sources, Smart Clean NYC eliminates diesel truck pollution and significantly reduces CO₂, NOₓ, and particulate matter.
05/ Enhanced safety
– WCPs and WCBs reduce the need for manual labor, minimizing workplace injuries and improving safety for both workers and pedestrians.
