<h1><b>👋🏼 Welcome to Crafticulate, an Archiving the Language of Making 👋🏼 </b></h1>

<p><b>Crafticulate</b> <i>is about preserving and documenting pottery gestures—those silent movements of the hand that embed generations of knowledge into clay.</i>  

<p>It uses machine learning, hand tracking, and interactive storytelling to transform the ephemeral knowledge of artisans into a living, growing digital memory.</p>

---
<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/ending.jpg" alt="Crafticulate" style="width: 100%;">
<p>I've always been fascinated by how knowledge moves—not through textbooks or blueprints, but through hands.  
Growing up around craft communities in Thailand, I often watched artisans work: shaping clay, weaving fibers, carving wood.  
They rarely spoke instructions. Instead, their hands danced silently, passing knowledge through movement, intuition, and shared memory.</p>

<p>Yet as cities modernized and traditions formalized, I began to realize how vulnerable this bodily knowledge is.  
Unlike written language, craft gestures often go undocumented. They vanish quietly when an artisan retires, or when urbanization displaces a community.  
When we lose these gestures, we lose entire ways of seeing, feeling, and relating to the world.</p>

<p>This growing awareness shaped the core questions that drive Crafticulate:</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <p><b>Can we preserve the silent language of making?</b></p>
  <p><b>Can technology help capture the living, breathing memory of craft beyond static documentation?</b></p>
</blockquote>

<h3><b>🧶 Why Craft Gestures Matter</b></h3>

<p>Artisans tell stories through their hands.  
A slight pressure, a wrist turn, a coiling motion — these are more than just physical acts. They are repositories of tradition, intuition, and embodied skill.</p>

<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/artisan.jpg" alt="artisan" style="width: 100%;">
<p>But unlike spoken language, these gestures often go undocumented.  
When they disappear, we lose more than a technique—we lose culture, relationships to materials, and ways of inhabiting the world.</p>

<p>Craft gestures are dynamic, not static. Yet most documentation—photographs, videos, written guides—flattens them into static representations.  
They fail to capture the richness of movement:  
its timing, its evolution, its silent dialogue with material.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Traditional craft learning happens through physical observation and repetition, not verbal instruction.</li>
  <li>If an artisan retires without an apprentice, the lineage of making can vanish quietly.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/local.png" alt="Crafticulate" style="width: 100%;">


<p>Other fields—like American Sign Language and dance notation—have developed ways to document movement computationally.  
Could we imagine similar systems for preserving and teaching craft gestures?</p>

<p><b>Crafticulate explores this idea:</b>  
<i>Preserving the language of craft through machine learning and interaction, not through frozen images.</i></p>

<h3><b>🚕 The Journey Toward Crafticulate</b></h3>

<p>Crafticulate didn't emerge all at once.  
It grew from two earlier research paths that shaped how I think about craft, space, and knowledge:</p>

<h1><b>🌐 The Digital Tapestry: Uncovering Hidden Networks </b></h1>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> 
<video src="/img/2025/crafticulate/digital tapestry.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>
</div>
<p>My first investigation, "The Digital Tapestry," mapped the invisible ecosystems of craft communities in Bangkok.  
It started with a simple question:</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1rem;">
  <p>What if craft communities existed right under our noses—yet remained invisible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through interactive maps, soundscapes, and image archives, I explored how informal trust networks, spatial memory, and shared material practices sustain these communities—despite being absent from formal records.</p>

<p>Preserving craft, I realized, isn't just about finding artisans or cataloging techniques.  
It's about capturing the <i>fragile, often invisible systems</i> that allow craft traditions to breathe and adapt.</p>

<h1><b>🧾 Nonlinear Interactive Instruction: Embodied Learning Systems</b></h1>

<p>Building on that, I shifted direction in <b>Colloquium II</b> —starting not with space, but with instruction itself.</p>
<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/instruction.jpg" alt="instruction" style="width: 100%;">
<video src="/img/2025/crafticulate/clay-hand tracking.mp4
" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

<p>How do you learn a craft technique?  
You don't read about it. You watch. You mimic. You adjust by feel.</p>
<video src="/img/2025/crafticulate/fastinstruction.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

<p>Through speculative interfaces and real-time gesture tracking using <a href="https://procession.spatialpixel.com/">Procession</a> (developed by <a href="https://spatialpixel.com/">Spatial Pixel</a>), I explored whether embodied, nonlinear learning could be digitized:  
Could a digital system teach not through rigid steps, but through movement, experimentation, and adaptation?</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1rem;">
  <p><b>How do you teach the slight press of fingers flattening clay?</b></p>
  <p><b>How do you capture a thumb's subtle rotation into the curve of a bowl?</b></p>
</blockquote>

<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/poster.jpg" alt="poster" style="width: 100%;">
<p>I found that craft learning is inherently nonlinear, cyclical, and deeply resilient—but also fragile when cut off from embodied practice.</p>

---

<h3><b> 🧶 Crafticulate:</b> Weaving Systems Together</h3>

<p>These two threads—mapping hidden systems and designing embodied learning—ultimately wove together into Crafticulate.</p>

<p><b>Crafticulate treats gestures as living memory:  
moldable, relational, adaptive.</b></p>

<p>It is a speculative tool, a digital playground for pottery gestures:  
each gesture a key, each interaction a moment of making, feeling, and learning.</p>
<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/iconcraft.png" alt="Crafticulate" style="width: 20%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">

<p>At the heart of Crafticulate is the idea of <i>moldability</i>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🟤 Clay is moldable.</li>
  <li>📚 Knowledge is moldable.</li>
  <li>💻 Archives should be moldable—not rigid museums, but living, breathing systems shaped through participation.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>🎨 Crafticulate in Action</b></h3>
<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/enter.png" alt="enter" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;">

<p>When you visit Crafticulate, you begin at the <b>Gesture Gallery</b> —  
a constellation of floating pottery gestures you can explore freely.</p>
<video src="/img/2025/crafticulate/gallery.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline style="border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;"></video> 
<p>You can filter gestures by:</p>
<video src="/img/2025/crafticulate/filtering.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline style="border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;"></video> 
<ul>
  <li><b>Process</b> (e.g., forming, shaping)</li>
  <li><b>Stage</b> (e.g., centering, finishing)</li>
  <li><b>Application</b> (e.g., bowl-making, vase-making)</li>
  <li><b>Hand Use</b> (single-hand, double-hand)</li>
  <li><b>Technique</b> (e.g., coiling, pinching)</li>
  <li><b>Cultural Context</b> (comparisons across traditions)</li>
</ul>

---

<h2><b>🎟️ Following a Gesture Journey </b></h2>

<p>Suppose you choose <b>bowl-making</b>.  
You're guided into a process timeline—almost like a recipe made of movements.</p>

<video src="/img/2025/crafticulate/recipe.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline style="border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;"></video> 

<p>Each gesture flows into the next:  
kneading, pinching, pulling, lifting—each shaping the clay toward form.</p>

<h3><b>🔍 Diving Deeper: Gesture Metadata Pages</b></h3>

<video src="/img/2025/crafticulate/metadata.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline style="border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;"></video> 

<p>When you click on a gesture—say, <i>Ball Kneading</i>—you open its deeper archive page, revealing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 3D model of the gesture, which you can rotate and animate.</li>
  <li>A description of when and why this movement is used.</li>
  <li>The tool or material involved (hands, ribs, wheels).</li>
  <li>Voice reflections or short clips from artisans sharing personal insights.</li>
  <li>Cultural overlays comparing similar gestures across global craft traditions.</li>
</ul>

---

<h3><b> 👐🏻 Practicing the Gestures Yourself</b></h3>

<video src="/img/2025/crafticulate/recognition .mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline style="border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;"></video> 
<p>When ready, you can turn on your webcam and practice a gesture live.  
A real-time hand tracking model maps your movements through 21 keypoints, offering visual feedback—like a digital mirror guiding your hands.</p>

<p>Because gestures live on a spectrum, the system doesn't enforce rigid categories.  
Small variations are part of learning, just as theey are in real craft.</p>

<h3><b>🔍 Technical Development Journey</b></h3>
<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/method1.png" alt="technical" style="width: 100%;">
<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/method2.png" alt="technical" style="width: 100%;">

<ul>
  <li><b>Step 1:</b> Recording artisans performing pottery gestures using webcam capture and MediaPipe.</li>
  <li><b>Step 2:</b> Tracking 21 hand landmarks (X, Y, Z) and extracting movements into JSON format.</li>
  <img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/giphy-1.gif" alt="technical" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;">
  <li><b>Step 3:</b> Preprocessing data into CSV files, plotting landmarks in 3D space using Matplotlib.</li>
  <li><b>Step 4:</b> Building a gesture classification model using TensorFlow.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/playtest_cut-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif" alt="technical" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;">
<img src="/img/2025/crafticulate/graph.png" alt="technical" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;">

<p>Model training reached ~100% accuracy in training and ~95% in validation—strong results but slight overfitting risks.</p>

<p>Depth perception posed a major challenge.  
Webcams struggle to capture subtle Z-axis shifts (e.g., pinching vs. pulling motions).</p>

<p>To improve accuracy, I expanded my dataset through multi-angle recordings and began live user playtests, revealing how users interpret and embody gestures differentlyy.</p>

<h2><b>Future Directions</b></h2>

<p>Crafticulate remains a living project.  
Future goals include:</p>

<video src="/img/2025/crafticulate/contribution.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline style="border-radius: 0.06 px; border: 1px solid black;"></video> 

<ul>
  <li>Expanding the dataset with more diverse user contributions.</li>
  <li>Refining gesture recognition across different hand types and movement speeds.</li>
  <li>Building adaptive recognition for both one-hand and two-hand gestures.</li>
  <li>Refining 3D visualization using p5.js or Three.js for richer feedback.</li>
</ul>

---

<p> For me, Crafticulate is not just about storing craft—it's about reactivating it.  
<b>It's about feeling it in your fingers, translating it across generations, and inviting others to mold it anew.</b></p>

<p><b><i>Craft is knowledge.  
Knowledge is movement.  
Movement is memory.</i></b></p>

<p><b>I hope you enjoyed Crafticulate as much as I enjoyed making it.</b></p>
