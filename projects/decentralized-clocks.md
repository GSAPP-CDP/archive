Clock time is a kind of data which is always  perceived  as universal/placeless. It is used to benchmark other data as a way to compare information across data sets. Despite its highly standardized characteristic, clock time is actually very local and contextual. Starting from when it is created, we have to average, adjusting for discrepancies  of the time from 821 atomic clocks in over 62 countries with unbalanced contribution. Time from the atomic clock is also not synchronized with earth rotation which slows slightly from year to year. To compensate, starting in 1972, metrologists began occasionally inserting something we call leap second at the end of the day. As a result , we have some minutes that are longer than 60 seconds. These all assembly processes take time. So once a month the Bureau of timekeeping(in France) will publish the perfect time in the form of a newsletter, called Circular T and send it to member countries to synchronize the clock.


The way we distribute time from the master clock is also attached to places. Through internet infrastructure, NTP ,  timezone and daylight saving, all are  politically influenced. Timezone, for example, is originally divided by what countries want to be in the same economic zone. It Also changed back and forth as a symbol of whether the country is  getting along with neighboring countries or not. Finally, When the time data is sent to local places . It crashes with local implications like language, geolocation, devices. We can see that time is not absolute truth but a cultural artifact. The number we see on our smartphone is produced by someone and some machine,  in a place and, actually, a time. However, this One single system is highly pervasive, our lives are now governed by one single centralized system.

If “space” uses a map as a medium to communicate data, “Time” uses a clock. While  within  cartography, there is no assumption that all maps should be considered a representation of  standardized, accurate, precise and homogeneous space. Instead maps are more often developed through attention to the spatial problem. So, the question is  how we might design  alternative timepieces for the non uniform, always changing needs of the society, and challenge dominant narratives of clock time?
 
Looking back to the history of Horology, time has been measured through some kind of physical elements : water, candle, incense, sand , sun and so on. However, present  technology allows us to measure things that seem uncertain and have no pattern. So we can use it as a new tool to measure time and see the world. The project proposes a system of  machine learning which will make predictions from data gathered by sensors  and send it from central intelligence back to the local device, visualize it alongside the data from the local sensor, and display the Tension between universal and local data. This system will reverse the process of time distribution from centralized to decentralized, The clock time would no longer be a one way process. People around the world  would be able to  contribute to universal time. 

The modern notion of time which demands us to do the same thing at the same time was made up a few decades ago.  The result is we need to design the electrical infrastructure to meet the peak requirement of the day. We go out to the street in rush hour to waste more fuel and time. We leave the business zone quiet after work hours. The project asks for  more alternative ways of telling time. As clock time affects how people live,  variety of clock time means cultural diversity and different space usage.
