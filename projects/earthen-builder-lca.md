Earthen Builder LCA involves visualizing a locality's soil data to decarbonize building materials through digital play and gamification. The soil dataset was gathered from the USDA soil map along with the topographic height data from the USGS World Map to render real-world landscapes. The activity was developed in Unreal Engine and focuses on creating digital tools for the public and heightening a knowledge base for material accessibility. Documented is the proof of concept video along with the final tool walkthrough video.
