Climate change is one of the greatest threats to the whole world. Continued rising heat, sea level rise, and extreme weather times threaten urban residents, communities, and our built environment for the foreseeable future. Buildings account for two-thirds of New York City’s GHG emissions. This reality makes retrofitting existing buildings critical important and improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings becomes critically promising. 

New York City is leading the trend in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. New York City has introduced a number of laws and programs in place to improve building energy efficiency. Here is a list.

Among these, law 97 is the latest law on energy efficiency in New York City. According to Local Law 97, by 2024, most buildings over 25,000 square feet need to meet new energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission restrictions, with the goal of reducing the emission of the largest buildings in the city by 40% to 2030.

Intuitively, this law can encourage existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency through retrofitting. But is that true? Because many buildings may prefer to pay for the penalty than to spend money on retrofitting. To answer this question, we can use Energy Star Score data. 

The ENERGY STAR score provides a comprehensive snapshot of your building’s energy performance, taking into account the building’s physical assets, operations, and occupant behavior. It is expressed on an easy-to-understand 1 to 100 scale, where the higher the score, the better the energy performance of the building.

Therefore, I compared Energy Star Score data in 2018 and 2020, for the law was enacted in 2019. From these two charts, we can find that Local Law 97 is likely to have a positive impact on Energy Star scores.

The Empire State Building is a good example. Over the last 10 years, the Empire State Building has undergone a ground-breaking energy and efficiency retrofit as part of the $550 million Empire State Rebuilding restoration program. Despite being 90 years old, the building is in the top 20% or better of all Class A commercial assets in the nation. The Empire State Building has an incredible 6,514 windows. During the retrofit, they retrofitted every single one of them, quadrupling the energy performance while reusing over 96% of existing materials all onsite.

However, many buildings are still facing serious energy waste problem. The Seagram Building is one of them. As the millennium’s most important building and the sample of modernism, its Energy Star Score is only 3 out of 100, making it one of New York’s most energetically wasteful office blocks. High energy efficiency starts at 75 on the Energy Star scale. Therefore, an article argues that it is time no longer to praise the Seagram Building, but to bury it. 

And it reminds us of rethinking the modernism.
