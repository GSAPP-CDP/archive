The Hyper Local Food Movement seeks to encourage cities and towns to move towards the majority of food being grown where it is being consumed. Cities listed as leading this movement include Portland, Maine, Des Moines, Iowa, and Alberquerque, New Mexico. For many, this ideal is seen as the only solution for cheaper, healthier food, with advantages advertised as:

- Adding variety to your diet with fresher food;
- Addressing food insecurity within cities;
- Cutting transportation costs;
- Supporting the local economy; and
- Tastier food thanks to organic and eco-friendly farming practices[^1].

But is this even possible for a city like NYC? What are the true implications of hyper-locality on
the scale of a city as dense as NYC? Would a hyper local NYC actually bring positive change? And is it even possible for NYC to become significantly hyper local to the point where it would positively impact our food system?

These questions, and the hyper-local narrative, both exist against the backdrop of a city whose current population is not fully fed. In 2021, it was reported that there are 2.4 million men, women, and children who are struggling to make ends meet within New York City, with 1.5 million of those being food insecure[^2].

With these numbers in mind, my research project seeks to answer the following questions: What would the total possible output of a hyper-local NYC be, and where could this be implemented within the city? What would the city need to sacrifice in order to achieve this? At a minimum, could a hyper-local New York City help significantly combat food insecurity within the city?

To answer these questions, I will develop a gamified computational tool called The Little Apple which will allow users to explore potential sites for urban agriculture within the city. Using Portland’s urban agriculture program as a template, we will score each potential location based on size, soil quality, sunlight analysis, and proximity to highways and areas of food insecurity. This will allow me to assess the total number of individuals served, total number of individuals needed for production, and total loss of amenities for each site.

Users will then be able to explore these locations individually and by category in order to best understand the urban agriculture landscape of NYC. Each selection will present the total change should this site be converted to an urban farm, and selecting multiple locations will summate each location’s total change. To make this exploration as comprehensive as possible, there will be the option to explore locations placed both in open spaces (parks, lots, etc.), as well as locations that have existing structures. These two levels will allow me to conduct my analysis on two scales: first, the NYC that exists today, and second, a more fluid and potential future NYC.

Finally, using machine learning, this data will be analyzed to find an equilibrium of most individuals served while sacrificing the least number of amenities per surrounding area along both scales. As a result, it is my hope that I will be able to both definitively answer my project questions as well as provide a proof-of-concept tool for this city, and hopefully someday other cities, to use in order to expand their urban agriculture programs.
