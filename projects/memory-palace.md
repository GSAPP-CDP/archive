GPT-3 has become a hot topic recently, with AI technology playing a variety of roles in people's lives. This project can be seen as an extension of the summer colloquium, which continues to explore the relationship between human memory and AI technology and the future direction between them. With the current trends, the integration of AI into our daily lives and even helping us manage stored memories is no longer a fiction scenario. So what is the current AI technology's processing mechanism for human memory, which can be specified as emotional text, image, sound, smell, touch, perception, etc.? And what will be the future attitude of human beings to deal with third-party technology to interfere with human personalized privacy, emotions and memories? These are the questions that should be explored and considered in this project. 

So, what is GPT-3? GPT-3 is a neural network machine learning model trained using internet data to generate any type of text. In simpler words, it requires a small amount of input text and will generate large volumes of relevant and sophisticated machine-generated text. There are a variety of functionality in GPT-3 which includes, text completion, code, completion and chat assistance, etc. The GPT-3's simulation of human speech intonation, content, and logic is derived from a large amount of data training. But it is not difficult to see from the conversation with it that the context of its dialect is indeed machine-like and designed to be rational. The official GPT-3 does not understand the details of the user's emotional input and can only respond with plain and general answers, which inspires me to think whether the result will be more human if we use more personalized and emotional text data to train GPT-3.

Then how to define memory? Quoted from Epistemology of Memory, memory is an approximation of some facts. In other words, memory generally alters significantly what enters it. When we recall some episodes of the past, those recollecting are not the retrieving, but rather the generating of representations of the past. It actually generates new beliefs about the past. There are two common categories of memory, which are Semantic memory that indicates proposition of memory, and Episodic memory that refers to actual events of memory. Epistemic theory, therefore, mainly focuses on these two kinds of memory and illustrates an interesting concept, that is whether practical knowledge can be fully understood in terms of various propositions. In simpler words, the goal is to explore whether knowledge-how is reducible to knowledge-that, and how to use various knowledge-that to build knowledge-how.

Thus the memory palace is the combination of AI technology and memory. Based on epistemic theory, the project uses memory-pretrained GPT-3 to explore the potential of AI aiding human memory reconstruction. The ultimate goal is to explore machine interaction with human memory context and think about how AI will affect our way of processing our memory in the future. 

How to design this experimental project and what kind of methodology and data should be used in the training process? Different from general training of GPT-3, which is feeding tons of data of all categories from the Internet, the training in this project is to feed the model with massive memory data, which will be documented as text. Then the pre-trained model will be fed immediately with some random day diaries that were written by me a few weeks ago. Therefore, there will be another entity besides the pretrained GPT-3 and random day diary, which is me with some fuzzy memory of what happened on that random day. Then the memory seeking process begins between me and GPT-3, starting with a pre-set Q&A format. 



The ultimate goal for this kind of mechanism and process design is to test how GPT-3 conducts the conversation based on emotional context and explore how AI interferes with the human memory reconstruction process.
